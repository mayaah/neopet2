Title: Neopets 
Team Members: Maya Hernandez, Jonathan Wong, Timothy Tran, Nathan Soufer
Demo Link: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56211271/railsdecal.mp4

Idea: An application based off Neopets in which users can experience a virtual Neopet-like world.

Models and Description:
User
has name, email, password, 
has_many neopets  
has_many petpets
Neopet
has various attributes (hunger, color) 
belongs_to User
PetPet
has various attributes
belongs_to Neopet

Features:
Neopets can battle each other for in game currency called neocoins.
There’s a shop to spend neocoins for “items” to customize your neopet
Color, food to increase loyalty

What more we have to do:
Create the test files for the models and controllers
On the Users’ page, have a button that links to the adoption agency and there you can select to adopt a neopet
Also on the user’s page, we display every neopet with their name, hunger, loyalty and color
Below each Neopet we have a Battle button and a Feed button:
The battle button has a success rate of 75% and will generate a coin from winning and increase loyalty if you win or decrease if you lose
The feed button requires three coins and increases the fullness value of each pet
